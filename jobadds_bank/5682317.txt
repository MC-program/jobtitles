Our Story
Liberty Global is one of the world's leading converged video, broadband and communications companies, with operations in 6 European countries under the consumer brands Virgin Media, Telenet and UPC. We are a family of great companies. While we each describe ourselves differently, and have distinctive personalities, we're more alike than we are different.
Our deep-rooted family heritage and entrepreneurial energy have shaped our unique culture and incredible growth journey. And the best is yet to come. Never before have we invested more in our customers, our people and our company. We work across functions, businesses, geographies, complex projects and programs. We are united by expertise rather than divided by location.
At times it can be a crazy place to work and navigate. You have to like a bit of chaos and be comfortable with ambiguity. Growing with us means taking a chance: to stretch outside your comfort zone, to grow through unprecedented and unpredictable change, to have the freedom to experience new possibilities, to supercharge your development.
